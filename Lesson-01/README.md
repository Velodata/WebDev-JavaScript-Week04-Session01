# What Are We Teaching in This Lesson?

In this lesson, we're teaching students **how JavaScript classes interact with the DOM** in a practical, hands-on way. By combining **JavaScript classes** with an interactive **HTML form**, students will see how object-oriented programming (OOP) applies to real-world scenarios.

---

## **Key Concepts Covered**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding JavaScript Classes**
- What a **class** is and why we use it.
- How to define a **constructor** and initialize properties.
- How to create **methods** inside a class.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Working with Objects**
- How to **instantiate** an object from a class.
- How to **store user input** into an object‚Äôs properties.
- How to **use class methods** to process and display data.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Connecting JavaScript to the DOM**
- How to **retrieve user input** from text fields, radio buttons, and checkboxes.
- How to **dynamically update the page** using JavaScript (`innerText`, `innerHTML`).
- How to **use event listeners** (button click ‚Üí call a class method).

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Encapsulation & Data Organization**
- Storing user data inside an object instead of using scattered variables.
- Making code more **modular**, **reusable**, and **organized**.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Real-World Application of OOP**
- Simulating a simple **user profile system**.
- Showing how **JavaScript classes** make code **scalable** and **maintainable**.
- Understanding the difference between **instance properties** and **static methods** (later topics).

## **What the Students Will Do**
‚úî **Fill out the form** (enter name, age, select gender, and check skills).  
‚úî **Click a button** ‚Üí JavaScript **creates an object** from the input.  
‚úî **See their information displayed dynamically** using a class method.  
‚úî **Modify & expand the code** (for advanced students).

## **Next Steps**
Once students grasp this, we can extend the lesson with:
- **Adding an "Update" button** to modify object properties.
- **Creating a subclass (e.g., `Student extends Person`)** to introduce inheritance.
- **Storing multiple objects in an array** to simulate a mini database.
